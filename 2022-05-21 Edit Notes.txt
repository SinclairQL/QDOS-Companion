p3:
PC.MCTRL = PC_MCTRL = 18020 (not 18021)
PC.INTR  = PC_INTR  = 18021 (not 18022)
PC.TPDATA = PC_TDATA
Changed all these mnemonics to PP_NNNN throughout the book

p5 System variables: Added note about using offsets rather than fixed
addresses.

p6 Removed nonsense about not using prefixes in mnemonic names.


p164, first line of last example:

MOVEQ #1,D1 this many bytes wanted

should be:

MOVEQ #6,D1 this many bytes wanted

Throughout:

By convention, offset and address mnemonics should be of the form PP_NNNN,
while values should be of the form PP.VVVV. Sub-values, like bit numbers
should be of the form PP..VVVV. None of this is followed in this book and I
find it too much trouble to alter that. I think this book has had its day
and is only of use as a historical relic.
