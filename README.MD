The QDOS Companion, written by Andrew Penell, December 1984

ISBN 0-946408-69-6

If you want to program in machine code on the Sinclair QL,
then The Sinclair QDOS Companion will enable you to get
to grips with QDOS, the large and powerful operating
system that the QL uses.

Andrew Pennell describes all the features of QDOS. Each
system call is covered, not only in terms of its function and its use, but also the exact steps it takes when carrying out its task. The complete input/output process is explained, including how device drivers work, and how to add your own to the system. The author also leads you through the various system variables and tables, as well as describing how to access the I/O ports within the machine.

A major feature of QDOS is its multi-tasking facility. A
detailed coverage of this capability is given, with emphasis on how to use it most effectively.

Andrew Pennell also describes the use of the 8049 second
processor to control the ancillary functions, such as sound and the keyboard. The book covers methods of controlling the second processor without QDOS, which is sometimes necessary.

Andrew Pennell is a university student and freelance programmer and author of Assembly Language programming for the Sinclair QL. He also contributes to several magazines, including Popular Computing Weekly, and has written software for a number of companies, including Sinclair Research.
